# Behavioural Genetics Lab Immersion 
##### Emilio Fern√°ndez Lavado

This repository contains the notebooks developed during  my immersion in the Behavioural Genetics Lab of EPFL (Prof. Carmen Sandi). The main goal during my lab immersion was to make use of my coding skills to help PhD candidate Jun Huang with his research project for understanding the underlying neural mechanisms of reward-based learning with detailed analysis of neural and behavioural data. The general structure of the project is explained in this [notebook](FinalNotebook.ipynb), which can be used by the reader as a guide thorugh the different aspects I worked on during my lab immersion. An example of the potential results of the DeepLabCut software toolbox is displayed below
